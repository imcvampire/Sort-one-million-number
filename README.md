# Sort one million number
------------------------------------

# Problem: 
Write a program in any programming language of your preference to sort 1
million of signed 32-bit integers using 3 MB of memory.

# Description:
This program's job is sort 1 million of signed 32-bit intergers using 3MB of memory. It reads from standard input and write to standard output (input/output format will be described below). 
This program is compiled by gcc 5.2.1 and is tested in Ubuntu 15.06. It could be compiled by other compiler and run in other OS.
This is binary compiled file in project (named `sort`). 

# Input/Output format:
Input and output is contained 1 million lines. Each line contains 1 signed 32-bit intergers number.

# Requirements:
- GCC 5.2.1 or newest.

# How to  build and run:
To manually build and run this project, you must have all requiremnts installed.

1. Run `gcc -o sort sort.c` in this project folder.
